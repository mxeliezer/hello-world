exploring github

At the turn of 40, with professional background accumulated in my former professional area (Psychology, Public Health, etc.), I decided to invest in programming and data analysis.
In part, this should reinforce my work as a political analyst. But this can go further, to new career paths. From the logic of programming, step by step, I want to become a developer.
Learning to handle, create, share and contribute to projects via Github is a must-have. That's why I'm here. #Hungtolearn
